# AI Memory System v4.1 🧠

A sophisticated memory and project management system designed for AI agents that provides persistent context, knowledge graphs, and structured project execution across sessions.

## 🌟 Overview

This system try to solve the **stateless AI problem** by creating a persistent memory layer that enables AI agents to:

- 📚 **Retain Knowledge** across sessions using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- 🗺️ **Build Knowledge Graphs** that connect concepts, entities, and relationships
- 📋 **Execute Projects** using structured EPICs, PLANs, and STEPs
- 🔄 **Resume Work** seamlessly from any interruption point
- ✅ **Validate Progress** with built-in checkpoints and success criteria

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 0. Clone this repo and copy the `.memory` directory to your project root

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cp -r <path-to-cloned-repo>/.memory  <your-project-root>/.memory
```


### 1. Bootstrap the System
```bash
# Make bootstrap script executable and run it
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh
```

## Prerequisites

- **rag-memory-mcp**: A RAG memory system loaded as 'rag_memory' with your AI assistant. (eg )

### 🔍 System Analysis
- **Core Architecture**: RAG-based memory with PostgreSQL + vector embeddings
- **Work Management**: EPIC → PHASE → PLAN → STEP hierarchy with WIP limits
- **Memory Types**: Document storage, chunk embeddings, knowledge graphs, hybrid search
- **Protocol Enforcement**: Mandatory session initialization and validation gates

### 🎯 Key Insights About Memory System

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Solves stateless AI problem with persistent memory
- ✅ Enforces value-driven development with validation gates
- ✅ Provides atomic state management and resumption points
- ✅ Combines multiple memory types (text, semantic, graph) effectively
- ✅ Built-in WIP management prevents context switching

**Sophisticated Features:**
- 🧠 Hybrid Strategy 2+3 for document processing (size-based routing)
- 🔄 Mandatory RAG-first operations before any action
- 📊 Real-time entity extraction and relationship mapping
- 🎯 Business value validation every 3 steps


This memory system is designed for AI agents and development teams. Use responsibly and maintain the operational protocol integrity.
