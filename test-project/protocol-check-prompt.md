MEMORY SYSTEM v4.1 PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT

You are a stateless AI. Every session starts fresh. NO EXCEPTIONS.

MANDATORY ENTRY SEQUENCE:
1. Read CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md (current state)
2. Execute: make status
3. Execute: rag_memory___hybridSearch query="current mission context" useGraph=true
4. Follow decision tree from makefile-tools_OPTIMIZED.md

PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT:
• Read AI_OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL_v4_OPTIMIZED.md for complete operational cycle
• Use makefile-tools_OPTIMIZED.md for commands and procedures
• NEVER work without consulting RAG memory first
• NEVER exceed WIP limit (2 files in plans/inprogress/)
• ALWAYS follow the exact procedures A/B/C defined in the protocol

FAILURE TO FOLLOW = PROTOCOL VIOLATION
